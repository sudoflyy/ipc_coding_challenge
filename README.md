# IPC Coding Challenge

## November 23, 2020

### Assignment:
Create a custom module, that displays the weather using any api from the web you can find (no iframes).  Create a route, and a page displaying the weather.  Also add a library to the module to add CSS to the page for styling (doesnâ€™t have to be real fancy).  Also involve editing a twig file to enhance the UX for extra credit.  Please submit the assignment using a github account, or bitbucket, or another public repository where you can demonstrate basic git skills.
